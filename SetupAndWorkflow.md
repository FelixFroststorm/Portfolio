# ⚙️ My Engineering Setup & Workflow

## 🏗️ Architectural Overview
I utilize a modular approach to separates my **Knowledge Base** from my **Attack Infrastructure**, ensuring data persistence, structure and workflow efficiency.

### Host Machine
* **Editor:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
* **Role:** Documentation, Knowledge base, Reporting, Git Management, and SSH orchestration.
* **Key Extensions:**
    * *Markdown All in One:* For rapid documentation structure.
    * *Paste Image:* For instant screenshot logging into report directories.
    * *Markdown PDF:* For generating client-ready executive reports.

### Attack Machine
* **OS:** Kali Linux (Virtualized)
* **Role:** Execution of offensive tools and network interaction.
* **Connectivity:** Accessed via SSH from the Host to maintain a unified terminal interface within VS Code.

## 📝 The "Golden Template" Methodology
To ensure consistency and reproducibility across engagements, I utilize a structured logging system. Every engagement begins with a standardized Markdown template that forces the separation of raw data from analysis.

### Documentation Structure
1.  **Enumeration:** Enumeration, service discovery, and initial recon.
2.  **Exploitation:** Precise recreation steps of the breach (Proof of Concept).
3.  **Post-Exploitation:** Privilege escalation paths and artifact collection and/or privilege analysis.
4.  **Loot:** Flags, hashes, and sensitive data (stored securely).
5.  **Suggested remediation:** Suggested remediations to harden, secure or reduce the possibility of exploitation.

## 🔐 Version Control & Security
* **Repositories:** I maintain strict separation between active engagements (Private) and public portfolio work (Public).
* **Sanitization:** All public writeups are scrubbed of sensitive client data or active contest flags before release.
