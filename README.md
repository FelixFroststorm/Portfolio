# Offensive Security Portfolio

## 👨‍💻 About This Repository
Welcome. This repository serves as a living documentation of my journey in **Offensive Security** and **Red Teaming**.

The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate my technical methodology, from initial enumeration to exploitation and remediation. It showcases my ability to not only execute technical attacks but to document them with the precision required for professional consulting.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each project contains the full assessment documentation in two accessible formats:

| Format | File Type | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Browser View** | `.md` (Markdown) | **Technical Review.** Optimized for reading directly on GitHub. Allows for easy code-copying, searching, and quick technical verification. |
| **Formal Report** | `.pdf` | **Offline / Executive.** A generated professional document suitable for archiving, printing, or sharing with stakeholders who prefer a finalized report format. |

## 🛠️ Methodology
My approach applies a **Systems Engineering mindset** to security. I do not rely solely on automated tools; I focus on understanding the underlying logic of the target to identify design flaws and architectural vulnerabilities.
